  notes: "Brinstar is a zone overgrown with vegetation. Having very recently been introduced to a lime-y cocktail known as a caipirinha, I decided to try combining it with another leafy drink - namely, a mojito. The resulting combination, plus a little extra, wound up being a tasty creation that I’m rather proud of."
