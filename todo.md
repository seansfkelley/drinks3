features
- react router for permalinking to recipes?

todo

- do animations for overlays and ingredient sections when they're created destroyed (ReactCSSTransitionGroup?)
- turn of autocorrect/autofill for search bars

bugs
- gotta use ontouchtap cause the 300ms delay is killing me
- the overscroll on the iphone status bar means you can drag it down away from the content of the status bar and it looks dumb
