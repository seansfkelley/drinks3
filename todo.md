features

- react router for permalinking to recipes?
- adding recipes

todo
- styling for ingredients
- clean up styling (more variables for sizes, things are in the wrong place)

bugs
- since modals reuse the same dom element, doing one and then the other really fast (i.e. before the 1s cleanup) makes it so they don't come in with a transition
