First:

```
npm install
npm install -g gulp
```

Then, for "production":

```
gulp dist
npm start
```

Or, for development, run each in a separate terminal session:

```
gulp watch
npm start
npm run livereload
```

Install the LiveReload browser extension to get live reloading behavior.

Then, visit [port 8080](http://localhost:8080/).
