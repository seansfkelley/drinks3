- memoization for derived values
- use reselect to make derived stuff memoized properly
  - caveat: if they call each other, you'll have to "dependency inject" them into one another so the tests are not running with memoized functions or something similarly obnoxious most likely
- add unit tests for derived values
- make RecipeSearch into (memoized!) utility functions since it doesn't need to do pre-processing anymore
- replace revalidator with proptypes, if it's been separated out into a library...?
