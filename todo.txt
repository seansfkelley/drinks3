- add unit tests for derived values
- make RecipeSearch into (memoized!) utility functions since it doesn't need to do pre-processing anymore
- replace revalidator with proptypes, if it's been separated out into a library...?
- actually use persistence
  - should probably load from old version of persisted data on first load, too
- thoroughly test all functionality to ensure it survived the transition
